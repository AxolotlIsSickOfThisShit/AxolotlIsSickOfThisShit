- Fun fact: Did you know that only `0%` of people who watch content on the channels [Axolotl Animates](https://www.youtube.com/@axolotldrawsandgames) and [Temmie](https://www.youtube.com/@temmieshorts) are not subscribed?
- You can fix that! Visit these channels and click the white, gray, or red %red% `Subscribe` % % button to subscribe to these channels. It's free, and it helps out a ton.
